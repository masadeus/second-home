List sharing made easy

<i>Second Home</i> is a web app that allows users to create inventories for a shared household, should it be a vacation house, a shared apartment or a tree house. With Second Home roommates, members of a family or any other sharing group can organize item lists in categories and add, edit or remove items, that they collectively use.
